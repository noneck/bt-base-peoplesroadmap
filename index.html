<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>
<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

          <h2>Connecting New York City to the 21st Century</h2>
          <p>
          Welcome to The People’s Roadmap to a Digital New York City. In this document you will find values and recommendations formulated by people of New York, for the people of New York, for the 21st Century. Through our roadmap, we look at technology as a catalyst for empowerment and bridging municipal management inequalities. </P>

<p>We see this document as a supplement to NYC Digital’s Roadmap, Manhattan Borough President’s Start Up City, and Chicago’s Technology Plan. Together, these documents paint an ideal nature of a digital city with programs and policies to address literacy, access, industry, and transparency. </P>

<p>Through the People’s Roadmap to a Digital New York City, we want to move beyond transparency. We want a government that asks us about our needs and is responsive to our problems. Written for the people, by the people, this roadmap has traveled to all five boroughs lighting a pathway for New York City to stay the world’s premier digital city. </p>

<p>“<em>Technology is not a slice of the pie, but the pan.</em>”  - Andrew Rasiej, Chairman of the New York Tech Meetup.</p>

<p>As of the November 2013 election, New York City is at a critical inflection point. A new cast of actors will assume powerful roles across government. This document will help guide this next administration and successive ones into community digital services. We see technology as a catalyst to develop smarter communities, deploy high speed accessible infrastructure, develop lifelong learning education initiatives, programs for employment and economic mobility, and effective and open government.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, we have established four universal digital freedoms:</br>
<ul><li>Freedom to Connect.</li></br>
<li>Freedom to Learn.</li></br>
<li>Freedom to Innovate.</li></br>
<li>Freedom to Collaborate.</li></br></UL>
</p>

<p>These four freedoms are the foundation for five core pillars in our roadmap:
<ul><li>Accessible Infrastructure</li>
<li>Education and Lifelong Learning</li>
<li>Industry, Employment, and Economic Mobility</li>
<li>Effective and Open Government</li>
<li>Smarter Communities</li></ul></p>

<p>In this roadmap, you will find 34 programs and opportunities that are critical to realizing a 21st century New York City. Cesar Chavez is quoted as saying “the fight is never about grapes or lettuce. It is always about people.”

<p>As the people of New York, we too agree that the fight is not about the bits and bytes, but about the people. We want all New Yorkers connected to the 21st Century’s opportunities for a truly connected 21st Century.</p>
